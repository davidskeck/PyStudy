PyStudy
=======

PyStudy is a tool to study any subject. Users can create tests using any question and answer set.

NOTE: Python 3.x is required.

Usage
=====

To create a new test, simply create a new folder in the same directory as main.py and name it after the test you are creating.

In this new folder, make an answers.txt and questions.txt file.

In these files, each question and answer should be on corresponding line numbers.

Example:


questions.txt line 1 contains "What is PyStudy?"


answers.txt line 1 should contain "A Python program that can be used to learn any subject!"
