A collection of physically separate, possibly heterogeneous computer systems, networked to provide access to the various resources that the system maintains:
A command to manage the execution of a process in a batch system:
A computer system in which multiple commodity computers are connected together by a network using MPI to perform parallel processing:
A function that is part of the OS that handles user requests for system resources such as IO:
A program that is loaded into memory and is executing:
A system that protects networks from security breaches:
In a modern OS, system processes execute here:
In 1984, Apple Computer introduced the Mac and was the first company to implement this type of user interface for the retail marketplace:
Running multiple jobs on a single processor:
The .NET framework would be an example of this:
The ability to continue providing service proportional to the level of surviving hardware in a parallel system:
The AMD Opteron processor uses this type of processing in which each processor has its own local memory and cache:
The code that makes up a Java .class file:
This company originated the first graphical device interface:
This company created and implemented the first virtual machine for computer systems:
Two or more processes executing at the same time on two or more processors:
Any of the shell programs in the Unix/Linux OS are examples of this:
The Intel quad core duo uses this type of processing where all the processors are peers sharing the same memory and bus:
The job of defending a system from internal or external attacks:
The heart of an operating system:
The program that is stored in the system BIOS and is responsible for loading the kernel and initializing it:
The register in a CPU that keeps track of the next instruction to execute in a process:
The technique of moving information to a temporary, more accessible location for quicker use:
This is used by programmers and developers to help find and fix errors in programs:
This is used by all modern operating systems so that the accessing of system resources is done through system processes and not by user processes:
